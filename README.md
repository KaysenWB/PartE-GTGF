Multimodal vessel trajectory prediction with generation flow models and spatio-temporal graph convolution. 
The input is trajectory data with the shape [length, batch, feature], and a corresponding adjacency matrix with the shape [length, nodes, nodes], which can be referred to the following code for data processing: https://github.com/KaysenWB/AIS-Process

Several key designs are hidden because the article to which the code corresponds has not yet been completed for publication. A full code version will be uploaded after the paper is accepted.
